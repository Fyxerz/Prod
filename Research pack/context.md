# Context analysis.

Within the global market, there is a clear definition in the popularity of windows as the predominant OS that is used, followed by OS X and then linux but significantly behind with only a 1.78% of the market [Resource](https://www.netmarketshare.com/operating-system-market-share.aspx?qprid=10&qpcustomd=0). With this, windows owns about 75% of the whole market which means that there is a massive range of users, using windows based operative systems. When looking at how operative systems are marketed, we should see a pattern in the way they are represented and therefore the kind of users they want to approach.

## Apple

OS X is presented as an elitist operative system, it doesn't try to show that it's simple, but instead it tries to show that it's elegant and only for the best. Because of this it has created an atmosphere surrounding young adults and designer heavy environments, where there is an interest in showing that they are in the bleeding edge of technology and trends. The fact that the OS can only be used in apple systems and that the price is extremely high, makes it so that it's not an operative system for casual users that don't need to use apple computers for a living, or that their usage doesn't have to be marketed. 

### Apps seen in the OS

Because of this, apps like Adobe Suite, Video, and photo suites are normally representative of the OS, as well as high profile designing and developing programs for "edgy" people.

## Linux

Linux is free and completely open source, this means that it is completely open to expansion and goes against the basic core values of what Apple intends for OS X It can be installed in any computer, but the installation method varies depending on the distribution and may require some technology knowledge. Because of the way and the context Linux and it's distributions were created (Ubuntu, Fedora, Mint, Korora....), there is not marketing behind them or resources put into being bought, this is because this operative system is free, but it also is because of the nature of it. This makes it so that there is very little casual user share in this operative system, normally used by more tech savy users that reject the concept that Apple has set in the industry.

### Apps seen in the OS

Because of the nature of the OS, most of the apps normally used in the OS are open source like LibreOffice, GIMP, and any suite of developer programs that can be installed by the apt-get system.

## Windows

Windows has set a standard for the casual user. It can be installed in any kind of computer and while it has a buying fee, it has resulted in a balancing point between linux and apple software, where it has achieved a level of aesthetic quality that attracts anyone, outside of the performance of it and at the same time it has provided this from a cheap perspective. However, the biggest thing that has created the success of the windows platform, is the fact that it has catered every single audience, looking from business environments, to gamers to children, to young adults and up to the elderly. Because of this, it allowed to create a dominance and an image that only helped increase its growth. Windows is the place to go when you don't want to specialize in something.

### Apps seen in the OS

The typical app seen in windows is an app that works for everyone. The Microsoft suite has created a set of very easy to use programs that don't look good, are not great, but do the job and are robust and it is because of this that it has generates a standard to what we normally want to use. Windows is polyvalent because it can be used for anything, and that brings a massive market with it with multiple opportunities, as long as the new program comes with the concepts integrated in what windows users want. Ease, and robustness.
