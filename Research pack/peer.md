# Peer review

## MD language
+ Tables are awful to write in, there must be an easier way.

## [Markable.in](https://markable.in/)

### Abailable for: SaaS service

### Sales pitch.
Presented as a normal MD editor, as a desktop app would be presented and tries to compete with that market. Has login authentication in order to be able to link the files to an account. Website is minimalistic and functional but not elegant or pretty.

#### Price: **Free**

### Features.
 + Minimalistic UI, similar to a windows 8 app.
 + MD color highlighting.
 + Live Preview.
 + Auto indenting.
 + Integration with cloud Services.
 + Allows for editor UI costumization but not output.
 + Outputs: MD, HTML, PDF.

### Conclusion
Strong editor, requires to sign in in order to work with it and doesn't even have a preview, which may detract users from trying. SaaS allows to be used in any SO but requires an internet connection.

## [Markdown here](http://markdown-here.com/)

### Available for: Browser extension.

### Sales pitch
Showcased exclusively to write e-maill, the user opens a textarea box and types MD down, which then exports as HTML which is copied and then pastied into e-mails.

#### Price: Free

### Features.
+ Extremely narrow and minimalistic usage.
+ What it does it does well.
+ It does very little (Only generates HTML from MD)
+ Allows for code and maths formatting.

### Conclusion
Has a very specific interest and does a very specific thing. It's useless as an actual editor.

## [Multimarkdown composer](http://multimarkdown.com/index.html)

### Available for: OSX

### Sales pitch.
Presents itself as a robust editor, that should replace every single other editor that the user may be using. The website used is not easy to understand or traverse. It's also very simplistic and not elegant.

#### Price: Donation

### Features
+ Syntax higlighting.
+ Can read word and other format types.
+ Has a ton of export types.
+ Syntax highlighting.
+ Spell checker
+ Word counter.
+ Table of contents.
+ Live Preview.
+ Change tally

### Conclusion
It's a strong editor with several very good features. It's only available to OSX and the site is not appealing, meaning that it's an editor for people that are already interested in MD. 

## [Scribble](http://www.tryscribble.com)

### Available for: SaaS

### Sales pitch.
Main page doesn't explain what it exactly is or what it does. This makes it difficult to understand, it only asks you to get started which then asks to create an acocunt (can detract from using). Website is very basic and doesn't explain anything. It's used to create wikis by using MD.

#### Price: Freemium up to 5 wikis.

### Features
+ Hosting for wikis.
+ Creation of several pages.
+ Allows to create a fully working wiki by using markdown.
+ Live preview
+ No spell checker.
+ Very basic MD CMS.

#### Conclusion
This is built for a very specific audiuence that wants to write markdown and wants to use this markdown to write a wiki.

## [Marked 2](http://marked2app.com/)

### Available for: OSX

### Sales Pitch
Website is aesthetically pleasing and explains what it is what it does and it's context very fast and easily.

#### Price: $10

### Features
+ MD live previewer.
+ Doesn't have any kind of editing functionality.
+ Allows the user to write in any editor he likes and previews it in there.

### Conclusion
The fact that it talks about favourite editor means that this is made for coders that are already used to their text editor and want to use it to write MD.

## [Markdown Pad](http://markdownpad.com/)

Avalaible for: Windows

### Sales pitch
Home page explains what it is very fast and shows features. Is free with a pro version.

### Price: $15 for pro version

### Features
+ Live Preview
+ Can modify editor.
+ Can edit output through CSS
+ Export as PDF and HTML

### Conclusion
Very strong editor that allows changing the output which is a USP, the fact that you have to write CSS to modify output gets a barrier of entry for people without coding knowledge.

## [WriteMonkey](http://writemonkey.com/)

### Avaiulable for: Windows

### Sales Pitch
Zenware - Basically there is no UI and has a very high entry barrier. Website also looks unattractive and explains very little.

### Price: Donations.

### Features
+ Extremely barebones that can then be expanded through plugins made by other users.

### Conclusion
The extremely barebones structure and explanation of the app, makes it very difficult to understand and almost an ideological concept piece more than a functional program.

## [iA Writer])(https://ia.net/writer/ios/)

### Available for: Apple devices and Android.

### Sales Pitch
Very pleasing website with a very nice video which doesn't explain absolutely anything about the actual program. It certainly shows a very strong "apple-y" vibe, and has a very minimalistic idea surrounding it.

### Price: $4.99

### Features
+ Very minimalistic UI, looking very similar to the typical Apple UI.
+ File Browser
+ Easy to use
+ Minimalistic UI
+ Focus on handheld devices.
+ No live preview
+ No output editing

### Conclusion
While the desktop app is also very good, it seem like the strength of the app lies on it's ability to mix it up with hand held devices. It also doesn't look like something a developer would use and the UI appeals to a more mainstream 'design-y' audience. 

## [Mou](http://25.io/mou/)

### Availblae for: OSX

Sales pitch:
Defines itself as a Markdown editor for developers.

###  Price: Donation

### Features
+ Live preview
+ Editing of UI
+ Exports to PDF and HTML
+ Has custom actions to change top uppercase and lowercase.
+ ~Word counter
+ Very minimalistic UI

### Conclusion
Very complete and powerful editor, that has a mid entry barrier for people that are not used to shortcuts and working with markdown. Focuses on efficiency instead of ease of use.

## [Haroopad](http://pad.haroopress.com/)

### Available for: Windows

### Sales pitch
Very little explanation about the features of the program, there's just a presentational video that doesn't clarify much.

### Price: Donation

### Features
+ UI editing
+ Live preview
+ Export in HTML, PDF
+ Menu with element add in.

### Conclusion
While it is a complete editor, it doesn't have an easy introduction to MD, which may be deterring users from entering, while there are two types of program (User and Developer) the user application doesn't actually provide any ease of use or introduction to the language.
