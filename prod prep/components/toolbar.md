# Insertion toolbar

In order to make the use of the app much easier for people that have never used markdown, the program will have a complete insertion toolvar in order for the user to add the headings and elements that they may want without having to know the markdown syntax.

When applying an element through the toolbar, it will apply the markdown syntax to the text on the cursor position or if highlighted an area it will replace the text with the markdown syntax.

## Insertion toolbar elements

+ Headings (H1, H2, H3, H4, H5,H6)
+ Lists (Ordered and Unordered)
+ Bold, Cursive, Underline
+ CSS styling options menu shortcut
+ Images
+ Links
+ Tables won't be allowed to be inserted with the markdown parser used in the MVP
