# Spell checker

## Javascript Spellcheck

Javascript spellcheck worked just fine, but the website demonstrating how it worked was from 2004 and didn't look like it was cared for at all. While it seemed to work just fine, I decided against working with it as it seemed too old, which may mean that lacks documentation as well as I should use as modern components as possible in order to work with the latest technology in order to explore the more modern approaches as possible.

## Typo.JS

Typo.js is a small library that runs several different languages and allows not only for spell chack but also suggestions of similar words. It uses spellcheck dictionaries through calls to online dictionaries, which means that spellchecking would become unavailable if the application is started offline. Even then it is very powerful and works vey well.

## Spellcheck HTML attribute.

The Spellcheck attribute seemed like the best way to deal with spellchecking, if it wasn't for the browser support. With very limited browser support and the need to set it up in a way that isn't intuitive or comfortable for the user. Because of this, it is just no viable to use the HTML attribute, even though it looks like it will be the way to go in the close years.
