# View Menu

The view menu will allow the user to customize the UI. This UI being very minimalistic will be very simple to modify and work with. Because the main native menu bar won't be able to hide, there is no risk of the user hiding the view menu and then not being able to show the UI again. As this bar is very small, it shouldn't come as a problem when working on content.

## The user will be allowed to show or hide:
+ Editor
+ Preview
+ Insert Toolbar
+ Word Counter Toolbar
