# File menu

The file menu, should work only for actions pertinent to the management of files and therefore shouldn only be related to node's fs module. This file menu will do the same as typical word processors allow. Allowing for creation of new files, as well as saving and opening already created files by using the native file explorer that the operative system has, thanks to the runtime engine.

While printing will not be primordial, it is still a good feature to have, and can be easily done through node's printer module. This module will not be set in the MVP but would be of interest to add the functionality at a later time.
